# Assignment_1
I learned how to navigate the Jenkins interface to configure and run a pipeline job.
I used the "Build Now" button to trigger the job and monitored its progress through the build history and console output. 
The Stage View provided a clear visual of each pipeline stage and its status. 
I also practiced modifying the pipeline by adding a new stage and verified the changes through a successful rebuild.
This hands-on experience helped me understand how Jenkins automates and visualizes build workflows.
